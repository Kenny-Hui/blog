# Everything about...
## About me
Hello! I am {Constant.author} (Previously known as LX86), you may call me **Amber/amb** for short! ^-^

I occasionally do some Minecraft modding, maybe some web development and little open source programs for others to use!

I may not be able to become the next steve job or the next influencer making billions of dollars, but it is still my mission to provide as much values to the world during my time living.  
The web finally allows the world to be interconnected with each other, it serves as an opportunity to share the things you make and you love to everyone, and perhaps one day someone will stumble upon the stuff you make and improve their life in some way~

If you have anything to ask me, please do! I am equally as interested of someone wanting to learn more about me.<br/>
Preferably via [Email](mailto:amberfrost@lx862.com) so that I can reply a thousand words back to you if I want to, but if you can also contact and follow what am I up to on my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jzbhWEBFPx).

For the work I've done so far please check out my [main site](https://lx862.com) because that's the only way I can get people to visit my website... what you came from there?

## About this blog
Here I document some of the more interesting/niches things, discoveries, and occasionally some of my stories.<br/>
I don't get the energy to write blogs all day long, but I hope that one day someone will find my website and have something useful to take away from it, or at the very least, have a better understanding of me in general.

And a reminder (again) that I am not an native english speaker. I am really bad at formulating long sentences and I do apologize if some of the wording used are a bit weird.

This blog is originally based on Beautiful Jekyll hosted on GitHub page, but later moved to Eleventy, and finally to Astro which I have mostly been pretty happy with :D
