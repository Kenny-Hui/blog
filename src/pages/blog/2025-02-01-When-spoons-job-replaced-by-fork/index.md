Amid the crisis of [ChatGPT's job getting replaced by AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepSeek#Assessment_and_reactions) where investors freaks out that you can save money by being smart about it, people with me irl have been freaking out about how I only eat exclusively with a fork, and I am here to tell you that a fork really isn't as bad as you think!

Most people associate a fork as the utensil to use when eating spaghetti/noodles (Because you can twirl it up), or Steaks (Because you can puncture through the steak).  
But also because of its ability to puncture things, most edible stuff can be punctured through (e.g. toast/pie/salad), which makes it immediately more useful and have a way wider application.

Contrary to public belief however, a fork *can* hold a decent amount of stuff, just like a spoon!  
Sure it won't hold liquid, and it may not hold as much as spoon, but it gets around there 75% most of the time. That's because most stuff we eat simply isn't miniature enough that the gaps in the fork actually makes a noticeable differences.

For cooked rice, they usually stick together pretty well, so it's not like each individual rice are separate from each other and fall through the gaps.  
Even for ice-cream, you dug a piece into the ice cream and assuming it's not melting (And if it is, you have bigger problem!), these piece are just like any other solid food, so you're pretty much just getting the spoon experience.

One area where a spoon still have an upper hand is holding liquid, but given that most consumable liquid are stored in a reasonable container, a neat workaround [^1] is to move your container towards your month and drink it, which perhaps is slightly easier than it is trying to eat a steak with a spoon?

Of course that's not to say you should only use one utensil, but also fork is a very versatile tool that is more capable than people think, and it also happens to steal half of spoon's job.  
If I am in a restaurant that serves steaks with rice, I would happily choose a fork over using both a fork and a spoon. And if the restaurant ran out of spoon to serve, they should first evaluate why they are still in business in the first place, but a fork is also not the end of the world :)
