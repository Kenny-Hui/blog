I've noticed an increase of words that I see everywhere but I don't actually know what they mean or understand their usage (skibidi, rizz, aura etc.)

Just a couple of years ago I thought I knew just about every viral trend on the internet, and now for the first time I can feel the same way my parents feels about my messages.

I can't tell if it's due to me getting older, or my recent habit of avoiding social media and therefore not catching up with the trend.  
Either way, it's all a bit scary, I am still considering whether to "learn" and adapt these words, or to give up entirely and admit that my prime time is over?

*Oh as a side note, did you know that the European Union [have a page](https://youth.europa.eu/get-involved/intercultural-understanding/gen-z-slang-words-and-phrases-of-2024_en) for a list of Gen Z slangs?*
